This app contains all the tools needed to mount /system rw, which is a precondition for a permanent root.

## DISCLAIMER 
This app is provided as a demo for advanced users. No responsibility is taken, it might turn your phone into a brick. 

/!\ YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED /!\

Also, this app relies on a special partition layout for step 4 and 5 so be sure your /data/local/tmp/backup/TS_partition_layout.txt (TS being a timestamp from when the backup was taken) looks EXACTLY like this

```

## Installation
The .apk needs to be installed on the phone. This can be achieved in multiple ways, e.g. by downloading it from a webserver, copying it to a mediacard or using "adb install". The option "Unknown sources" under Settings -> Security must be enabled.

## Usage steps
### 1. Copy assets
First, the used binaries and images need to be copied to the right places on the phone. Since the app contains a full modified boot image, it is so huge and might take a little while.

### 2. Backup
In order to have the best chances to fix the system in case something goes wrong, a couple of files are backed up (e.g. the original GPT table and boot/recovery images). The data can be pulled via adb from /data/local/tmp/backup/.

Since system images are pulled, this step can take a while, the GUI might hang.

### 3. Modify partition layout GPT
A small hole in the partition layout is used to remap the recovery partition to a modified boot image, which is written in the last step.

### 4. Write modified boot
The modified boot image is written to the remapped location.

## Rooting
After all steps have been performed, the phone has to be unplugged from USB, then turned off. Now press the volume down button (as if entering recovery) until you see the AT&T logo. Now the custom boot should fire up which enables read/write access to /system.

In order to have permanent root, this would be a good time to install a current version of SuperSU and ADBD Insecure.

Also, removing bloatware is now possible.

To go back to the stock kernel (without r/w on /system), simply reboot the phone.

## Restoring Recovery
Nothing got deleted, so in order to get back into recovery when pushing the volume down button on boot, only the partition table has to be restored, which can be done as root via

/data/local/tmp/root/sgdisk --load-backup=/data/local/tmp/backup/TIMESTAMP_mmcblk0.gpt /dev/block/mmcblk0

Note: the timestamp should be from the original backup made when pushing "backup" in the app for the first time.

## Troubleshooting
If something goes wrong, you should be always able to normally boot the phone, temporary root it and look at logfiles and the contents of /data/local/tmp. If in doubt, reboot the phone and try the whole procedure again.
